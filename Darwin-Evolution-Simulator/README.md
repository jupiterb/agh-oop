# Darwin Evolution Siumulatior

It is a simulator designed to show the simple behavior of the environment.
Animals moving on the map (their movement is influenced by their genotype) try to survive by eating grass that "grows" cyclically, thus depleting energy. 
Statistics on the entire simulation are also collected, such as the number of animals, the dominant genotype.


The project was written for the course "Object-Oriented Programming" in university, in December 2020.
